Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera MOOC

This repo contains the following files:
* run_analysis.R: an R script that creates a tidy data set consisting of the mean of each mean and standard deviation variable in the original data set.
* SubjectActivtyMeans.txt: the data set created by the R script above.  It contains a row for each subject/activity pair.
* CodeBook.md: a code book that desribes all of the variables in the SubjectActivityMeans.txt data set.


Go to town!
