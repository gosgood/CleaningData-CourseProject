Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data
============================================

This repo contains the solution files for the course project that is part of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.  The primary purpose of the project is to synthesize a tidy data set that "summarizes" a larger data set.  The larger data set, which is publically available, contains measurements of human activity.  The following files are part of this repo:
* run_analysis.R: an R script that creates a tidy data set consisting of the mean of each mean and standard deviation variable in the original data set.
* SubjectActivtyMeans.txt: the data set created by the R script above.  It contains a row for each subject/activity pair.
* CodeBook.md: a code book that desribes all of the variables in the SubjectActivityMeans.txt data set.


Go to town!
